# ESDA
ESDA (Easy Snake Descent Algorithm) is a simple symmetric encryption algorithm inspired by AES. The encryption process of ESDA 4x4 operates on a 4x4 numerical matrix.
[The principle is as follows](https://arrive-software.github.io/2025/03/07/%E8%BE%BE%E5%93%A5%E9%9B%86%E5%9B%A2%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE/)
